TCHelper is to provide some useful tools to calculate thermodynamic properties of gas-phase molecules. 

For the latest updata, there are two tools named TORSION and TORTHERM. Both of them are written in the Fortarn language.

# Content
* Program name: TORTHMO

  Features: Calculating the thermodynamic properties of each internal rotation of molecules.

* Program name: TORSION

  Features: Calculating the thermodynamic properties with and without some torsion modes of molecules.
